# This is a file that can be used with Podman's Quadlet functionality. You need to use Podman +v5.2.1 though.
# You put it in ~/.config/containers/systemd and then reload systemctl daemon using following command: systemctl --user daemon-reload
# Then you can start your container by running systemctl --user start qor-caddy
# I have a SELinux system so that's why every mount is riddled with z, or Z flags, otherwise SELinux kicks in and stops container from being able to write to these directories on host.
